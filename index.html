            <h2>Data Science</h2>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                I am a Data Science Master’s graduate with a recently completed Master’s in Data Science and Social 
                Analytics from the University of Durham. My academic background has equipped me with advanced skills 
                in statistical modelling, inferential statistics, hypothesis testing, machine learning, natural language 
                processing, computer science, and programming. I am eager to apply these skills to uncover actionable insights, 
                support evidence-based decision-making, and solve complex real-world problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am particularly passionate about using statistical and analytical methods to identify trends, model behaviours, 
                and evaluate outcomes, helping organisations make smarter, data-driven decisions utilising regression analysis, 
                classification models, causal inference, and machine learning techniques like neural networks and ensemble learning.
